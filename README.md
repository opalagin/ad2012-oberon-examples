# Oberon examples from Algorithms and Data Structures by N. Wirth

This is a collection of some examples from the book. I use this project to test and play with algorithms w/o modifying them to any other programming language. The big role in that plays Excelsior's IDE - XDS wich supports Modula-2 and Oberon-2 and works on Windows and Linux. 

## Building

1. Download and install XDS SDK. Add it to your binary path.
2. Use xc to compile a project. For example: xc =project exp/exp.prj
