# Oberon examples from Algorithms and Data Structures by N. Wirth

This is a collection of some examples from the book. I use this project to test and play with algorithms w/o modifying them to any other programming language. The big role in that plays Excelsior's IDE XDS wich supports Oberon-2 and works on Windows and Linux. Note that book doesn't cover Oberon syntax and its program structure. But you can learn that from http://inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/Oberon/PIO.pdf. 

## Building

1. Download and install XDS SDK. Add it to your binary path.
2. Use xc to compile a project. For example: xc =project exp/exp.prj
